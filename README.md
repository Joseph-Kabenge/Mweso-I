# Mweso-I
The Ordinary Mweso Game
Mweso-Game is an android game application that depict or duplicates the native mweso game that is played in Africa and some parts of Asia. This an effort to bring the lovely game mostly played in Eastern Uganda to life The idea is to have user experience the game from novice player to expert level. Using the most common mobile operating system, we aim at using explicit graphic to allow for identification with the real world native game. Game sounds that are similar to village sceneries are to be used.
